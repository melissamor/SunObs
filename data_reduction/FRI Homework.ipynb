    "Look through all of the data we have and pick an observation that you would like to look through. The naming convention is such that the string of numbers after the word \"sun\" is just the date (yyymmdd). In order to help you choose a good observation date, you can refer to the Space Weather Live website and look at solar flares that may have happened on the dates these observations took place. It would be great to find a flare in our observations, but it's alright if you aren't able to! We are at a solar minimum, meaning the Sun isn't very active right now.\n",

    "When you have chosen a data file, go ahead and read it in below! From the file, you should save the time and date of the observations, the wavelengths at which the observations were taken, and the fluxes of each wavelength and the time at which those fluxes were recorded. It may help to view the file in a text editor so you know what the general layout is. Having trouble reading it in? Try googling different solutions or feel free to ask me!\n",
